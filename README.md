# fat16reader

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC) and [@AmandaIsrael](https://www.github.com/AmandaIsrael) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Operating Systems class we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Coded entirely in Python, it reads a FAT16 image and allows the user to navigate through its content.
